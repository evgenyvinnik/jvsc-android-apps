2011-xx-xx v1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Now uses portaudio v19 (thanks to spctrl and drasish), and ALSA if
  available. That means you shouldn't need to stop all sound-using apps
  before launching Musagi anymore.
- Now saves config.txt and log.txt in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config/musagi.

2010-08-01 v1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Compiles and runs under Linux.
- Added double-click handling.
- Fixed SDL keyboard input (works with non-qwerty keymaps too.)
- Added GTK requesters to replace Windows requesters.
