Everyday is a thrill ride.
Manage that ride with the 24 clock.
<br/>
Jack your homescreen.
A stylish widget clock where every second counts.
<br/>
The action never stops with hourly, 1/2 and 1/4 hour chimes.
Full of options<!-- and integrated with Timeriffic -->.
<br/>
The following widget takes place on your desktop.
Events occur in real time.

Day 1 features:
<ul>
<li>To create a new stylish 24 clock widget, <i>long-press</i> in Home
and select <b>Widget &gt; 24 Clock</b>. </li> You can then configure widget
specific options before installing your widget.
<li>Use the "24" icon in the all-apps drawer to configure global settings
such as hourly chime or global mute. </li>
<li>Hourly chime and other sounds will <b>not</b> play when your device is
muted, in vibrate-only or during a phone call. </li>
<li>Battery saver: clock stops updating when the screen is off or after
30 seconds when you're not in the Home app. </li>
</ul>

<a name="known"><h2>Known Issues</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>The <em>24 Clock</em> widget has been tested with the default Android
Home app. It may not work properly with alternate home apps. </li>
<li>If you use a custom home app and the clock never updates in home,
try to uncheck "Detect Home is Active" in the global options. </li>
</ul>
